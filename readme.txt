## Background Processing  

- This plugin utilizes the [WP Background Processing](https://github.com/deliciousbrains/wp-background-processing) library by Delicious Brains to efficiently handle background tasks without affecting the user experience or website performance.  

- The library enables asynchronous processing of large datasets and operations by leveraging the WordPress Cron system. This ensures that critical tasks such as API data fetching, batch processing, or heavy computations are handled smoothly and reliably.  

- We extend and integrate this library to manage the background processing of:  
  - Fetching accounts, locations, and reviews in batches.  
  - Importing large datasets into WordPress.  
  - Performing other time-intensive operations.  

- For more information on this library, visit its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/deliciousbrains/wp-background-processing).

   **Purpose** The plugin saves the Google My Business API refresh token in a secure third-party API service to generate temporary access tokens. These tokens are provided to the user's site, which uses them to securely fetch data from Google My Business and perform operations such as retrieving locations, reviews, and managing review replies.
   
   **Data Sent** The Google My Business refresh token is stored securely in the third-party service solely to facilitate access token generation. No additional personal or business information is shared.
