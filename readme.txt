## Background Processing  

- This plugin utilizes the [WP Background Processing](https://github.com/deliciousbrains/wp-background-processing) library by Delicious Brains to efficiently handle background tasks without affecting the user experience or website performance.  

- The library enables asynchronous processing of large datasets and operations by leveraging the WordPress Cron system. This ensures that critical tasks such as API data fetching, batch processing, or heavy computations are handled smoothly and reliably.  

- We extend and integrate this library to manage the background processing of:  
  - Fetching accounts, locations, and reviews in batches.  
  - Importing large datasets into WordPress.  
  - Performing other time-intensive operations.  

- For more information on this library, visit its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/deliciousbrains/wp-background-processing).
